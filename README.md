## Notes

This is a iOS Timer App made with Swift and Xcode that utilized the timer methods built into Swift. The plus button increases
the time by 1 minute and the minus button decreases the time by 1 minute unless the time is less than 1 minute then in that case it won't work as to go to negative time. The reset button resets the time and the play button starts the timer and turns
into a pause button while playing.
