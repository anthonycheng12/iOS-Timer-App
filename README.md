## Notes

This is a ChatBot made in Java that uses a two dimensional array that holds the inputs and potential outputs of the system. We make it non case sensitive by changing all letters to lowercase and deleting all the white space with the trim function. I used the Java Swing which is a GUI widget toolkit to create the interface and application for the ChatBot. JFrame creates the window, JButton creates a button to trigger things in the program, JTextArea is the editable text block to input things, JLabel helps organize the swing application. We use a action listener to give the buttons functionality. This program takes the users input and will output a response that is pre-programmed into the code.
